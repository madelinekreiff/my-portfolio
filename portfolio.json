      "description": "Using HTML and CSS, I created a responsive portfolio website. This was a project I completed through Skillcrush, an online coding program. I used a Photoshop design comp to extract font styles, colors and measurements to replicate the design in CSS, while using HTML to structure the content.

      "description": "Unplugged Retreat is a website for a business that provides company retreat services. This was the first project where I challenged myself to create this website project on my own with no hints or guidance through Skillcrush's course. I used a Photoshop design comp to determine specific fonts, spacing, and colors. When developing this website, I used a Mobile First design process to create a responsive web page for any browsing device. There are breakpoints in the CSS code for tablet and desktop widths and flexbox styles for an easy yet efficient layout.",
