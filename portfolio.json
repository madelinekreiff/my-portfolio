      "description": "Using HTML and CSS, I created a responsive portfolio website. This was a project I completed through Skillcrush, an online coding program. I used a Photoshop design comp to extract font styles, colors and measurements to replicate the design in CSS, while using HTML to structure the content. I wrote all of the code in Visual Studio Code."

It included an About & Contact section, Menu, Customer Reviews and a link to its location on Google Maps. This project focused heavily on structuring navigation bars and links in HTML and styling them in CSS, which I was able to master."

      "description": "In this Skillcrush project, I used CSS to style the provided HTML content in Visual Studio Code. There was no design comp, so I estimated the measurements by hand and was given a style guide to refer back to with the required fonts and colors. The main goal was to learn and practice additional complex CSS styles to create a clean layout."
