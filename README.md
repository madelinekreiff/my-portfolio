# my-portfolio

## gh-pages
This branch contains all of the data needed for my portfolio website in order to create clean, concise & reusable code.


## portfolio.json
portfolio.json consists of all the necessary information for each project (description, tools, links, etc) as well as
the descriptive paragraphs for the interactive about page.


## API
The GitHub API Documentation was used to fetch this data through JavaScript.


## Vanilla JavaScript vs React Library
My portfolio website is also hosted on this branch, which uses an HTML5 and CSS Boilerplate as well as Vanilla JavaScript.

Check out my actual live website to see this exact web page replicated using the React library.
