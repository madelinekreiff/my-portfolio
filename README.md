# my-portfolio
This is the repo for my multi-page, dynamic and responsive portfolio website using Vanilla JavaScript. It also contains portfolio.json which my website uses to make an API call.

## portfolio.json
portfolio.json consists of all the necessary information for each project (description, tools, links, etc) as well as the descriptive paragraphs for the interactive about page.

## API
The GitHub API Documentation was used to fetch this data through JavaScript.

## Vanilla JavaScript vs React Library
Visit https://madelinekreiff.github.io/my-portfolio/ to view this website created from this branch using an HTML5 and CSS Boilerplate as well as Vanilla JavaScript.

Check out my actual live website to see this exact web page replicated using the React library.
